## Hi there 👋

I am a frontend developer with experience in creating dynamic and interactive web applications. My expertise lies in working with modern frontend technologies such as React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

## About Me 💁

I've started my career as a web developer. With a strong support from my coding friends, I quickly moved from courses to practice. I value code clarity and transparent structures. As in the past I had the possibility to work directly with the customers, I know how important it is to create UX-friendly, functional design. In my everyday life I’m a calm person, dedicated to my passion which is Brasilian Jiu Jitsu. I'm also a loving father of a golden retriever-husky mix, Loki. 🐶
